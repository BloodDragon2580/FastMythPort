With FastMythPort you no longer need to look for the teleportation
spells to the dungeons in your magic book.

You just click on the Minimap Icon.
There you click on the dungeon you want to go to and that's about it.
You can see more in the pictures.

 

Of course you have to have played the dungeon at
+20 InTime beforehand to get the port there.
